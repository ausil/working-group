# Meetings

## Day and Time

The main OKD Working Group meeting happens every other Tuesday at 5:00PM UTC. On alternating weeks, the OKD Community Development Subgroup meets at 5:00PM UTC. Please check the OKD Fedora Calender to see which weeks.

## Joining the Meeting

We use zoom for our meetings, as it is the most ubiquitous of the video conferencing options. We want our meetings to be as accessible to the public as possible.
